#Forecasting Wait Times at the US/Canada Border

## Summary
Travel delays are a frustrating reality of driving and are particularly pronounced when crossing the US/Canada border.  Reliable and accurate predictions of wait times are not available to travelers.  This project will model the wait times at the border crossings in northwest Washington and provide users with a more reliable forecast of wait times for dates in 2016.

## Motivation
Each year, over 4 million passenger vehicles cross into the US from Canada at Blaine, WA, the main border crossing between Seattle and Vancouver.  At the secondary crossings at Lynden, WA and Sumas, WA over 1 million passenger vehicles cross yearly.

Wait times at the border can exceed 2 hours depending on day of the year and time of day.  State and provincial government agencies offer online tools displaying real-time wait times.  Due to the distance between the border and major population centers, this information is typically only helpful to those who are already on the road.  Real-time data is effectively stale by the time a traveler reaches the border, so the information is typically used for selecting a specific border crossing.  

For those planning future travel, only general guidance is available.  For example, Canada Border Services Agency offers advice on peak hours and peak wait times based on day of week and major holidays.  Although helpful, travelers would benefit from more accurate hourly forecasts.  Alternatively, a web app from the University of California offers wait times by hour based on day of week.  Unfortunately, these wait time combine both holiday and non-holiday data.

More accurate forecasting by day of year and time of day would have multiple benefits.  Travelers could better plan their travel to minimize wait times.  In aggregate, border traffic can be better distributed across border crossings and times of day, reducing wait times for all travelers.  Border agencies could leverage the forecasts to improve capacity and resource planning.
